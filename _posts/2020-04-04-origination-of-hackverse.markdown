description: Story behind the idea of attending a National Level Hackathon (HackVerse) at NITK, Surathkal which was my first Hackathon
---

Sometime in November, while I was preparing for my midsem suddenly I received a Whatsapp notification from T&P Club group that was about NITK, Surathkal is going to organizing an event called [HackVerse](https://hackverse.nitk.ac.in/), as asual i just ignored it. After few days one of my friend takled about hackathons in call like " Hackathons were great means to make an impact in the lives of the students and the learning curve students get by hackathons is immense and not to forget the experience - one of a lifetime in students’ academics life! " till then I don't know what is hackathon so it makes curious to attend any hackathon. 

Another day again I received same notification from Coder's Club group but this time didn't ignored it I took some time and started searching about both NITK, Surathkal and HackVerse then i came to know some interesting facts about NITK like it is one of the best NIT in India, it has it's own beach within college and beautiful campus interms of both nature and culture. I thought for a while and decided to participate in HackVerse'20 with one of my close friend Ramcharan. 

Immediately after completing our midsem we started searching about some projects in Machine Learning and we found one interesting challenge in Airport Authority Organization and we decided to submit that project idea. Yes, we submitted the project proposal and waiting results infact we don't have even 10% hope on selecting that is another thing. After some days pongal holidays were declared and  I am on my way to home in bus I just turned on my mobile data then I got Mail notification. What are you expecting this time?

Yes, we made it we were shortlisted for HackVerse'20 among 2400+ applicants. It made us very happy and on next day I received call from POC(Point of Contact) Pratika Goyal she helped us in booking tickets and told all other necessary formalities to be done, rules & regulations to attend hackathon. 

And the final day came Jan'25 the day was started with the inaugural ceremony. Notable folks from the industry shared their words of wisdom to the participants on how to be industry ready through hackathons and other competitions. Then we were gone through the following workshops: 
- Building a Search Engine with Elastic Search
- Best Practises for Using Containers in Production 
- Being a Technologist in Financial Services 
- Intelligent Things - How AI Will Be All Around Us 
- Devfolio 101 
- Why build on Matic?

Finally Hackathon started shortly, and we moved to classroom to set up our device. We are started working on idea in between we took break quite often to play carroms, table tennis and talk to others. Atlast we submitted our project for evaluated and the judges quite impressed with our idea and approching in solving the issue. We even though we couldn't win we are happy because the hackathon was beyond our expectaions and we enjoyed every movement. 

I had attended various hackathons before - major ones being [code.fun.do](https://www.codefundo.io/), [Smart India Hackathon](https://www.sih.gov.in/), [HackInOut](https://hackinout.co/) and was part of organizing some small ones organized by the technical clubs in college. In the pre-final year, our team didn’t get selected for Smart India Hackathon, that’s when we came to know about student-run hackathons in India. Honestly, it was a new concept for all of us and seeing the sponsors, plan and all seemed very promising. We applied to various hackathons, got selected, however, we couldn’t attend any of those due to some or the other reasons.

Meanwhile, the semester was near the ending and Core Transfer happened for a Technical Club named [IE NITK](http://ie.nitk.ac.in) for which I was part of and we were discussing different possible solutions on how we could make a better impact with our events on the technical community of the college and possibly nation-wide. That’s when I remembered about the student-run hackathons. Definitely, hackathons were great means to make an impact in the lives of the students and the learning curve students get by hackathons is immense and not to forget the experience - one of a lifetime in students’ academics life!

That’s when we pitched about the nationwide hackathon in college to the core members, One of the junior core members raised a question: “Isn’t this too much that you’re aiming?”. I replied saying "If so many other colleges could do, why not us?" That’s when we faintly discussed a nation-wide hackathon to happen in the college. The initial team was formed of diverse people in terms of skills needed for it to be a national level hackathon and not a small one. That was when I was reading a lot of blogs & resources online to organize hackathons of nation wide scale. Meanwhile, another member in the team, Namrata contacted various friends in other colleges who organized such hackathons to get an idea of the process. 

We decided on the following things for HackVerse:
- Completely free for all hackers
- Host around 250 hackers from all over India
- Have some technical talks & workshops
- Judges & mentors from prominent industry/startups
- Lots of Goodies for all
- Huge Prizes
- Great Experience

The aim was to make it the best technical event NITK has ever seen (beat the technical fest - Engineer too), make it the finest hackathon in India.

Since, it's going to be an event which would happen for the first time, it needed appropriate branding and hence we were pondering over the name and the logo. After discussing over 25+ names, trying out different designs in the logo, we settled up for the name **HackVerse** and the following logo:

The hackathon was supported by the [Diamond Jubilee Commitee](https://dj.nitk.ac.in/) of the college and happened to be an Institute Level Event. HackVerse was a huge success, and it defintely turned out to be one of the biggest and finest student-run hackathon across India. HackVerse offered prizes worth more than 1 crore, got support from 30+ national+international sponsors, 2400+ registrations, had amazing 6 technical talks, was judged by 10+ executives from various multinational companies and startups.

The team was definitely in-experienced in all terms (marketing, publicity, operations, hospitality, etc) for such a big event but the zeal among the members and the aim for which the hackathon was happening kept all of them going and the success had to happen. Cheers to each member in the team for all their contributions!
