description: Story behind the idea of attending a National Level Hackathon (HackVerse) at NITK, Surathkal which was my first Hackathon
---

Sometime in November, while I was preparing for my midsem exams suddenly I received a Whatsapp notification from T&P Club group that was about NITK, Surathkal is going to organizing an event called [HackVerse](https://hackverse.nitk.ac.in/), habitually i just ignored it. After few days one of my friend takled about hackathons in call like " Hackathons were great means to make an impact in the lives of the students and the learning curve students get by hackathons is immense and not to forget the experience - one of a lifetime in studentsâ€™ academics life! " till then I don't know what is hackathon so it makes curious to attend any hackathon. 

Another day again I received same notification from Coder's Club group but this time didn't ignored it I took some time and started searching about both NITK, Surathkal and HackVerse then i came to know some interesting facts about NITK like it is one of the best NIT in India, it has it's own beach within college and beautiful campus interms of both nature and culture. I thought for a while and decided to participate in HackVerse'20 with one of my close friend Ramcharan. We both just created a team and decided to submit the idea after completing exams. 

Immediately after completing our midsem we started searching about some projects in Machine Learning and we found one interesting project in Airport Authority Organization and we decided to submit that project idea. Yes, we submitted the project proposal and waiting results infact we don't have even 10% hope on selecting that is another thing. After some days pongal holidays were declared and  I am on my way to home in bus I just turned on my mobile data then I got Mail notification. What are you expecting this time?

Yes, we made it we were shortlisted for HackVerse'20 among 2400+ applicants. It made us very happy and on next day I received call from POC(Point of Contact) Prathiki Goyal she helped us in booking tickets and told all other necessary formalities to be done, rules & regulations to attend hackathon. 

And the final day came Jan'25 the day was started with the inaugural ceremony. Notable folks from the industry shared their words of wisdom to the participants on how to be industry ready through hackathons and other competitions. 

After the inaugural ceremony, the following tech talk sessions were there:

Atlast we submitted our project for evaluated and the judges quite impressed with our idea and approching in solving the issue. We even though we couldn't won the hackathon we are happy because the hackathon was beyond our expectaions and we enjoyed every movement.
